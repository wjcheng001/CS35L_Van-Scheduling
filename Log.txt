Log:
1. Implemented client-side approved driver form(by default, frontend: DriverApplication.jsx, backend: server.js)
- when user press submit, frontend checks whether all fields are non null
- then passes required fields like name, license number, state, â€¦ to backend. Backend stores them in mongoDB as a driverApplication object in a User document and updates the user's status from 'NOT_SUBMITTED' to 'PENDING'
- implemented a warning against double submission, user can proceed if they like. Involves modifying /api/auth/session in server.js to send DriverApplication.jsx a ping on whether a driverApplication document exist for the user
- implemented an autoapproval process for users
	License State is CA
	Expiry is > 4 mo from current date
	0 points
	DST within last 2 years
  The User instance in the database will also store a Boolean to indicate that the user is auto-approved for future admin audits

2. Implemented the 'Approved Driver Application' button in Header.jsx

- go to headers and hide home page for people already logged in
